Shows the commit ancestry graph starting from the commits named with <rev>s or <globs>s (or all refs under refs/heads and/or refs/tags) semi-visually.

It cannot show more than 29 branches and commits at a time.

It uses showbranch.default multi-valued configuration items if no <rev> or <glob> is given on the command line.

OPTIONS
<rev>
Arbitrary extended SHA-1 expression (see gitrevisions[7]) that typically names a branch head or a tag.

<glob>
A glob pattern that matches branch or tag names under refs/. For example, if you have many topic branches under refs/heads/topic, giving topic/* would show all of them.
